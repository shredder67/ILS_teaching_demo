# Building

If you want to build/run project, you need **.NETFramework V4.7.2** installed on your computer. To build, simply build with Visual Studio or run `dotnet run` command.

If you have other version installed, you will have to change `<supportedRuntime>` inside *App.config* file (but you probably will need to make manual changes to source code if errors occur, so I don't recommend that).
